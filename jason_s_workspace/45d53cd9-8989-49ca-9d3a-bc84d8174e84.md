# Redis

## Redis
**Redis** (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure store used as a **cache, database, and message broker**. It is designed for extremely low-latency operations and high throughput, making it a common choice in distributed systems and high-scale architectures.

---
### 1. Core Characteristics
**In-memory first architecture**
Redis keeps data primarily in RAM, which enables sub-millisecond response times. Optional persistence mechanisms allow data durability.
**Single-threaded event loop (core execution model)**
Redis processes commands sequentially using an event-driven architecture. This eliminates locking complexity and ensures predictable performance under high concurrency.
**Rich data structures (not just key-value)**
Unlike simple KV stores, Redis supports:
- Strings

- Lists

- Sets

- Sorted Sets (ZSET)

- Hashes

- Bitmaps

- HyperLogLog

- Streams

This makes Redis suitable for modeling complex application patterns directly.

---
### 2. Common Use Cases
Caching Layer
- API response caching

- Database query caching

- Session storage

Typical pattern:
App → Redis (cache) → DB (fallback)
Reduces database load and improves latency.
Session Store
Widely used for:
- Authentication sessions

- Shopping carts

- User state

Especially useful in horizontally scaled systems.
Rate Limiting
Using:
- INCR

- EXPIRE

- Sorted Sets

Common for API throttling.
Pub/Sub & Messaging
Redis supports:
- Publish/Subscribe model

- Streams (for log-like messaging patterns)

Used in lightweight event-driven architectures.

---
### 3. Persistence Options
Redis offers two main persistence mechanisms:
**RDB (Snapshotting)**
- Periodic point-in-time snapshots

- Faster recovery

- Lower runtime overhead

**AOF (Append Only File)**
- Logs every write operation

- Higher durability

- Slightly higher write cost

You can combine both for hybrid durability.

---
### 4. Replication & High Availability
Redis supports:
- Master–Replica replication

- Redis Sentinel (automatic failover)

- Redis Cluster (sharding + HA)

In production systems, Redis Cluster is commonly used to distribute keys across multiple nodes.

---
### 5. Performance Characteristics
- O(1) operations for many commands

- Sub-millisecond latency

- Can handle hundreds of thousands of ops/sec

- Memory-bound system (RAM is the main constraint)

---
### 6. When NOT to Use Redis
Redis is not ideal for:
- Large datasets exceeding memory capacity

- Heavy relational queries

- Complex transactional workloads

- Long-term cold storage

It complements relational databases rather than replaces them.

---
### 7. Redis in Modern Architectures
In microservices and cloud-native systems, Redis often plays roles such as:
- Distributed cache

- Distributed lock (SET NX)

- Leader election

- Job queue

- Real-time analytics counter

It is commonly deployed with Docker and Kubernetes in production environments.

If you want, I can go deeper into:
- Redis internal architecture (SDS, dict, skiplist)

- How Redis handles memory management

- Designing a high-scale Redis cluster

- Using Redis effectively in Python/Docker production setup

Tell me which angle you want.
